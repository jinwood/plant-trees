This project has been bootsrapped using create-react-app. You can use the following commands to run the app locally.
I have not tested `build` or `eject` but see no reason why they wouldn't work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
